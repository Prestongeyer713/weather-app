This web application lets you search for any city and get the weather results for the area.
You will see the citys temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
It will also give you that citys 5 day forecast.
When the user searchs for another city the side column will display previous citys searched for.
I've included a clear buttton get rid of the search history if desired.
My 5 day forecast row only displays the current date for each value but i assure you it is displaying the next five days and not five intervals of one day.
below is a picture of my applications functionalilty.
